Since people have been putting their Wordle [https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/] boards on Twitter I have been wanting to create a solution for posting the resulting board without using emojis which create a terrible user experience for people using screen readers.

I am not an accessibility expert, I have just heard of these issues before on different memes.

I am not a seasoned developer, so please bear with me, this was just for fun. LOL

I appreciate you checking it out.
